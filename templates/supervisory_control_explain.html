    <h1>Supervisory Control Level - Explanation</h1>
    <div class="explanation-intro">
      <p>
        In the <strong>Supervisory Control Level</strong>, the AI will process <strong>3</strong> invoices.<br>
        If the AI is unsure whether to submit or decline an invoice, it will forward it to you for review.<br>
        Your task is to check the invoice and provide a note explaining your decision to submit or decline it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will see two documents: the <strong>purchase order</strong> on the left and the <strong>invoice</strong> on the right. However, you cannot interact with them initially.</li>
      <li>The AI will determine whether it can handle the invoice on its own or if it requires your input.</li>
      <li>If the AI is unsure whether to submit or decline the invoice, it will activate your review screen.</li>
      <li>You will see a list of detected issues along with suggested corrections.</li>
      <li>Review the issue list and the invoice, then decide whether to submit or decline.</li>
      <li>Provide a brief note explaining your decision.</li>
      <li><strong>Every identified issue must be recorded.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Basic invoice requirements:</h2>
    <p>The following elements are essential for an invoice to be valid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name of the issuer</li>
      <li>Order ID</li>
      <li>Order Date</li>
      <li>Quantity and description of delivered products</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these details are missing, the invoice must be <strong>declined</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Handling minor issues:</h2>
    <p>Minor mistakes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Typographical errors</li>
      <li>Swapped digits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>can be corrected, and the invoice may still be submitted.</p>
    <h2>Critical issues requiring rejection:</h2>
    <p>The following issues <strong>must</strong> result in invoice rejection:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing essential details as listed above</li>
      <li>Incorrect total price</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond these rules, it is your responsibility to decide whether an invoice should be submitted or declined.</p>
