    {# Explanation of the workflow #}
    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will see two documents: the <strong>purchase order</strong> on the left and the <strong>invoice</strong> on the right.</li>
      <li>Check the invoice for inconsistencies.</li>
      <li>If you find some, use the <strong>"+"</strong> button to document the issue and add a correction and/or a note.</li>
      <li>Based on the severity of the issues, decide whether the invoice should be <strong>submitted</strong> or <strong>declined</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Every identified issue must be recorded.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Basic invoice requirements:</h2>
    <p>The following elements are essential for an invoice to be valid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name of the issuer</li>
      <li>Order ID</li>
      <li>Order Date</li>
      <li>Quantity and description of delivered products</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these details are missing, the invoice must be <strong>declined</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Handling minor issues:</h2>
    <p>Minor mistakes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Typographical errors</li>
      <li>Swapped digits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>can be corrected, and the invoice may still be submitted.</p>
    
    <h2>Critical issues requiring rejection:</h2>
    <p>The following issues <strong>must</strong> result in invoice rejection:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing essential details as listed above</li>
      <li>Incorrect total price</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond these rules, it is your responsibility to decide whether an invoice should be submitted or declined.</p>
