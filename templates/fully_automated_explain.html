      <p>
        In the <strong>Fully Automated Level</strong>, the AI will process <strong>3</strong> invoices
        and independently decide whether to submit or decline them.
        You don't need to take any action, but you can view the invoices while the AI is working on them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will see two documents: the <strong>purchase order</strong> on the left and the <strong>invoice</strong> on the right, but you cannot interact with them.
      </li>
      <li>The AI handles the entire process automatically.</li>
      <li>While the AI is processing an invoice, you can view the invoices.</li>
    </ul>
