    <div class="explanation-intro">
      <p>
        In the <strong>Cooperative Level</strong>, you will process <strong>3</strong> invoices. The AI performs a preliminary check and provides you with a list of potential issues. Your task is to verify whether the AI has identified all errors correctly.  
        If some issues are missing or incorrectly flagged, you can send a message, and the AI will reanalyze the invoice by comparing it with the corresponding purchase order.
      </p>
    </div>
        
    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will see two documents: the <strong>purchase order</strong> on the left and the <strong>invoice</strong> on the right.</li>
      <li>A list of potential issues detected by the AI will also be displayed.</li>
      <li>Review the list to ensure its accuracy.</li>
      <li>If everything is correct, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button on the first question.</li>
      <li>If there are mistakes or missing issues, provide corrections by sending a message to the AI.</li>
      <li>If you believe the AI cannot assist further or the invoice contains critical errors, click the <strong>Decline</strong> button in the second question.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>"Report Issue"</strong> button to document the issue and add a correction and/or a note.</li>
      <li>Based on the severity of the issues, decide whether the invoice should be <strong>submitted</strong> or <strong>declined</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Every identified issue must be recorded.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Basic invoice requirements:</h2>
    <p>The following elements are essential for an invoice to be valid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name of the issuer</li>
      <li>Order ID</li>
      <li>Order Date</li>
      <li>Quantity and description of delivered products</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these details are missing, the invoice must be <strong>declined</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Handling minor issues:</h2>
    <p>Minor mistakes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Typographical errors</li>
      <li>Swapped digits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>can be corrected, and the invoice may still be submitted.</p>
    
    <h2>Critical issues requiring rejection:</h2>
    <p>The following issues <strong>must</strong> result in invoice rejection:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing essential details as listed above</li>
      <li>Incorrect total price</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond these rules, it is your responsibility to decide whether an invoice should be submitted or declined.</p>
